# Date Picker with Calendar in JavaScript

This is a simulation of the **Android App Calender Event Date Pick**

No API is included, fully **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. It functions 100% like the original android kind.

I used the **IIFE Modular JavaScript design pattern** so it's easy to walk through from the **Controller Module** `controller.init()`
