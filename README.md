# Date Picker with Calendar in JavaScript

This is a simulation of the **Android Calendar Date Picker**

No API involved, fully **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. It functions 99% like the original android kind.

I used the **IIFE Modular JavaScript design pattern** so it's easy to walk through from the **Controller Module** `controller.init()`
